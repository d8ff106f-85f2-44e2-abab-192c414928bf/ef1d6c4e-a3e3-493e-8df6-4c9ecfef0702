summary: have big mesh, make cross section.

critical question: can I assume mesh to have tetrahedral cells?

worst case is loose triangle soup

can't open google drive link

mesh format:
- ~300MB file text file, sections delineated by $<section name> and $End<section name>, has MeshFormat, Entities, Nodes, and Elements
- list entities, each line starts with index number followed by arbitrary arr of values
- list nodes, index number // [n]vec3 // four int attrs?
  - last entry of nodes (797606) all [n]vec3
- list elements, one line of four int attrs then [m][n]int

KEY IDEA: only dragging the plane needs to be fast.
This means that I can do all the sorting after entering the plane angle
freezing during this precomputation is not mentioned in the reqs

5M elements, 
if all tetrahedra (coordination number 4),
worst case 20M vec3s, 
best case 5M * 4 / 4 = 5M vec3s

if I load them all into GPU memory and do an indirect draw call,
how much gpu mem does it use? 

elements: 5M * [4]u32 index = 80MB
points: 5M * [3]f32 * 4 / 4  = 60MB

140 MB, doable even on laptops

game plan:
- precompute rotated coords and sort by Z' axis
- precompute 1D AABB of all tets, referencing index of sorted coord 
- sort a min list and max list, ref sorted index
- on drag:
  - sweep through sorted coord list, find critical index
  - sweep through min list until value of index is at thresh
  - sweep through max list until value of index is at thresh
  - choose the shorter of the min/max list, worst case is 50% culled
  - allocate, loop through the chosen list and push intersecting tets, worst case is all are intersectiong
  - worst case: 2.5M u32 comparisons, say it's 10 cycles then at 1GHz it's 40fps -- might need further binning
  - now we get a list of triangles cut by the plane.


Deliverable Intermediates
step 1: (native) impl just culling, profile wall time, print to file
step 2: (native) add line list, profile wall time, print to file
step 3: rendering stuff

Bedtime. Coded a little bit after dinner for rough estimate of sorting 5M f32s and swap.

Unoptimized around 5 sec, optimized around 2 sec.

Memory swap might be the bottleneck compared to coord transform.
Need to benchmark sort vs transform on SoA vs AoS

also consider if matmul-then-insert is faster

...Ok matmul 5M elems is negligible

Checkpoint: raw matmul and sorting is acceptable. Leave it at naive impl and focus on culling now.

I have sorted list of points.

Assume list of tets.

keep arrs parallel so it's easy to memcpy whe building lists for in-place sort

Loop thorugh 5M tets:
  - given four vertices, record the indicies of the one with min and max Z
  - build unsorted aabb list (include the tet index for easy memcpy next)
    | tet | min | max |
    |-----|-----|-----|
    |  0  | 253 | 728 |
    |  1  | 129 | 417 |
    |  2  | 653 | 123 |
  - build sorted min list and max list
    | min | tet |     | max | tet |
    |-----|-----|     |-----|-----|
    | 102 | 233 |     | 301 | 623 |
    | 103 | 629 |     | 301 | 125 |
    | 103 | 192 |     | 302 | 920 |
    | 104 | 456 |     | 303 | 128 |
  - on sweep time:
    - binary search through sorted points list to find critical index
    - binary search where to cut the min and max list respectively
    - iterate over the shorter of the min/max list
      - naive: immediately start cuting the triangles, at most three faces cut
      - SIMD: build triangle soup, insert only if indices cross the critical index

checkpoint, close to early bedtime

pay attent to fencepost error for tets generation
