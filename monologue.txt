summary: have big mesh, make cross section.

critical question: can I assume mesh to have tetrahedral cells?

worst case is loose triangle soup

mesh format:
- ~300MB file text file, sections delineated by $<section name> and $End<section name>, has MeshFormat, Entities, Nodes, and Elements
- list entities, each line starts with index number followed by arbitrary arr of values
- list nodes, index number // [n]vec3 // four int attrs?
  - last entry of nodes (797606) all [n]vec3
- list elements, one line of four int attrs then [m][n]int

KEY IDEA: only dragging the plane needs to be fast.
This means that I can do all the sorting after entering the plane angle
freezing during this precomputation is not mentioned in the reqs

5M elements, 
if all tetrahedra (coordination number 4),
worst case 20M vec3s, 
best case 5M * 4 / 4 = 5M vec3s

if I load them all into GPU memory and do an indirect draw call,
how much gpu mem does it use? 

elements: 5M * [4]u32 index = 80MB
points: 5M * [3]f32 * 4 / 4  = 60MB

140 MB, doable even on laptops

game plan:
- precompute rotated coords and sort by Z' axis
- precompute 1D AABB of all tets, referencing index of sorted coord 
- sort a min list and max list, ref sorted index
- on drag:
  - sweep through sorted coord list, find critical index
  - sweep through min list until value of index is at thresh
  - sweep through max list until value of index is at thresh
  - choose the shorter of the min/max list, worst case is 50% culled
  - allocate, loop through the chosen list and push intersecting tets, worst case is all are intersectiong
  - worst case: 2.5M u32 comparisons, say it's 10 cycles then at 1GHz it's 40fps -- might need further binning
  - now we get a list of triangles cut by the plane.


Deliverable Intermediates
step 1: (native) impl just culling, profile wall time, print to file
step 2: (native) add line list, profile wall time, print to file
step 3: rendering stuff
